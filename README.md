# Simple MVC framework for PHP developers
This Simple MVC Framework for PHP was developed for learning purposes. It is perfect if you want to understand the Model View Controller (MVC) concept. You can also start your own project based on it (* this is not ready for production but it is 100% functional). Check the demo up and running at https://simple-mvc.com

Requires PHP 7.0 or later.

Please let me know if there is something to fix. Thank you!
